There are 5 UART ports on BBB, but 1 is dedicated for JTAG debugging console support

So, there are 4 UART available for user access

UART2
UART3
UART4
UART5

These UART ports are listed as /dev/ttyO0, /dev/ttyO1 etc
if you do a listing of /dev folder you may see only ttyO0 (it is OH-0)

So, we need to enable other UART ports if we want to work with them

/dev/ttyO1
P9_24	0×184	UART1_TXD	uart1_txd
P9_26	0×180	UART1_RXD	uart1_rxd

/dev/ttyO2
P9_21	0×154	UART2_TXD	spi0_d0
P9_22	0×150	UART2_RXD	spi0_sclk

/dev/ttyO4
P9_11	0×70	UART4_RXD	gpmc_wait0
P9_13	0×74	UART4_TXD	gpmc_wpn

inorder to enable these ports you need to run the following command

echo BB-UART1 > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots

replace the number with 1,2,4
5 didn't work out, will work on it later

Use pyserial library to connect to serial port
